    <h1 >The Mighty Cheetah</h1>
    <p>Back in the 90s, a magainze would sit on the table of every dentist's and doctor's table for the kids called Highlights. Highlights featured interesting topics for kids
        to read with intricate details into the exciting lives of animals. One caught my eye around the year of 1994 that featured the world's fastest cat known as the cheetah. Fast cat?
        Cool spots? Sharp teeth? Count me in!

    <p>This African large cat can run up to astonishing speeds of 80 miles per hour thanks to it's thin legs and it's sexy thin figure. It has lots of spots like a dalmation but don't
        expect to see 101 cheetah's anytime soon. Sadly, the population of the cheetah is deteriorating at a fast pace and it's unknown if in 100 years if this fast beast will be able
        to keep up with the race of living a non-extinct life.
